                <h2>Why does this website exist?</h2>
                <p>Well, Daniel just really likes cool artwork. Does that warrant 
                    creating an entire website just for it? We aren't really sure... In 
                    any case, we have selected three of Daniel's most favorite 
                    artists to showcase to you all. As an artist himself, Daniel has 
                    been inspired many times in his own drawings by these artists' 
                    works. We hope that you will enjoy these artists as much as
                    Daniel does. Happy painting!</p>
